Healtee

An app to help rural users to list the symptoms seen, generate premilnary advice. The data would be sent to servers for processing and analysis.
The users could then connect to specialists (Voice/Video calls). After the server proceeses the data from patients, the specialists could also connect to the patients directly. 
A call could be scheduled at a later time if a local nurse is needed for examination by the remote doctor.

The rural user led to picture-rich interface, supported with speech and text. Users could input data with voice in their local dialect(Hindi for now).
All this is designed to work in offline mode.

However, if there is access to internet, the users could connect via Skype.
