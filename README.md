#Healthee

An app to help rural users to list the symptoms seen and generate preliminary advice. The data(symptoms and user info) would be sent to servers for processing and analysis. The users could then connect to specialists (Voice/Video calls). After the server processes the data from patients, the specialists could also connect to the patients directly. 

A call could be scheduled at a later time if a local nurse is needed for examination by the remote doctor.

With rural user as primary audience, picture-rich interface is used in the app, supported with speech and text as secondary communication mode. Users could input data with voice(instead of typing) in their local dialect(Hindi for now).

All this is designed to work in offline mode. However, if there is access to internet, the users could connect via Skype.
